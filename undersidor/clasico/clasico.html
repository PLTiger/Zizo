        important clubs in the Spanish capital Madrid and Barcelona,

        that bring together the two teams in the Spanish League, but nowadays,

        between the capital Madrid, which is seen as the bearer of Spanish nationalism,
        and Barcelona, ​​which carries the banner of Catalan nationalism.
